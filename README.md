## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Using Flexbox
Mobile first 
Hover states 

### Continued development

I would like to use Tailwind to target a group of elements for a hover state.
I had trouble with the avatar image in webp format not resizing to fit the container - so I changed it to a png. I still dont understand why that was happening.


### Useful resources

- (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand flexbox because it has very clear illustrations.
